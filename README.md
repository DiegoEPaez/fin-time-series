<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This repository contains a project which aims to predict financial time series over time spans longer than a month. The reason is that it relies mainly on macroeconomic variables such as interest rates, inflation, and others. The repository contains the references to download information to predict S&P500 and USDMXN. Nonetheless it can easily be changed to predict other time series.
